# Getting Input

This is my plan
> 8 x 8 canvas  
> 64 pixels

Input: "A small blue bird, in green bushes"  
> Get all adjectives by scanning and comapring each word with an array of adjectives and nouns  
> Create a dictonary value for each noun: {"bird": "" "bushes": ""}  
> Each value has an array of the adjectives for its object {"bird": "["small", "blue"]" "bushes": "["green"]"}  

## Creating the Image

Pick a general location of the image to place the main object
> `X: 0 Y: 0`  
> Make the object size based of the description `20 x 20`  
> Place the object and get all the pixels it takes up  
> Make them the colour `Blue`  
> Make the rest `green` with some darker `greens` scattered throughout
